        <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
              This page represents all of the work I have done
              this 2018 Fall Semester in Dr. Lindgren's Writing
              and Digital Media class. We worked on three major
              projects, which each were a summation of skills we
              learned as the semester progressed. The 3 major
              projects we completed were: Data Visualization,
              Explained Video, and this DataStory Website. This
              website page is the product of the last project.
              In this page, I will explain the journey I've had
              this semester, using the notes I took in our Journals
              of Learning (JoL's).

          <h3>Week 1</h3>
            <p>
              In the first week of class, we had an introductory day
              and then basically jumped right
              into doing work. We learned about how to navigate the
              canvas page,
              and began to learn about our Data Collection Project.
              We also learned about the Dear Data project. This was pretty
              interesting for me because I didn't realize that information
              could be visualized in such a cool way. It encouraged me to
              start recording my data.
            </p>
          <h3>Week2</h3>
            <p>
              We started off the second week by looking at an article
              from Steven Katz titled "Classical rhetoric, technology,
              and the Holocaust." We used this reading to develop ideas
              about ethics in relation to what we would be doing in class.
              With this, we began to plan for what kind of data we wanted
              to collect.

          <h3>Week 3</h3>
            <p>
              The third week we took a break from coming to class, with the
              purpose of meeting with Dr. Lindgren about our ideas for
              Data Collection. At this time, I had the idea to record data
              from my text messages. I wanted to see the relationship between
              who I texted the most and the engagement I had with them, along
              with other factors.
            </p>
            <p>
              We set up conferences with Dr. Lindgren, then had to prepare a
              draft excel sheet for what our data collection would look like.
              My conference was pretty helpful, and I came out with an excel
              sheet that I started working with the next day.
            </p>
          <h3>Week 4</h3>
            <p>
            Week 4 was pretty slow in terms of class becuase
            we were mostly responsible for collecting our data.
            I realized it was a little harder to collect my data
            than I thought it would be. I luckily had all of the
            information basically already recorded on my phone,
            so throughout the day I would take breaks to record
            whatever text I had sent or received.
            </p>
            <p>
            We had a reading from A. Kirk about data visualizations,
            and had to take notes in our Journals of Learning about
            "CHRTS" which is: Categorical, Hierarchical, Relational,
            Temporal, and Spatial. We had to begin thinking about how
            we would make our Data Visualization with CHRTS in mind.
            </p>
          <h3>Week 5</h3>
            <p>
              We finished collecting data and started to design
              our Data Visualization. At first I had no idea where
              to start. I wanted to do something that was representative
              of how a screen looks on an iPhone when someone is texting.
              We started to learn how to design in a program called Inkscape,
              which was fun to use but hard to get a hang of at first.
            </p>
            <p>
              We watched a couple of tutorials that helped us understand how
              Inkscape works, and then revised some of our ideas for our Data
              Visualization project. Watching the tutorials didn't really help
              me with my design idea, but I definitely was able to undertstand
              a lot more about how the program worked. I think that if I had
              more examples of what other students were doing or had done, then
              I could've come up with something better.
            </p>
            <p>
              We met a couple times in groups to peer-edit each other's ideas,
              but when I met with people, none of their suggestions really
              stuck with me. I basicaly waited for myself to figure out a new
              idea that I thought I could potentially execute in Inkscape.
            </p>
          <h3>Week 6</h3>
            <p>
              I eventually figured out how to make the
              visualization look how I wanted in Inkscape,
              but it also felt very
              cluttered and wasn't as appealing as I thought it was going
              to be. I showed it to my classmates when we were group editing,
              and many said that I should try to come up with a different
              visualization idea. It took a couple tries, but I was able
              to figure out a new layout.
            </p>
            <p>
              I came up with my new idea by looking over the Dear Data projects
              we had looked at in the first couple of weeks. This not only gave
              me my idea for my visualization, but also helped me better
              understand my data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Towards the end of the week, we had to start coming up with the
              title, legend, and labels of our visualization. This was pretty
              easy for me because my design was a lot like a
              scatter plot.

          <h3>Week 7</h3>
            <p>
              After finishing the Data Visualization project, we started to
              look at resources for our Explained Video project. We watched
              a couple example explained videos on YouTube, then talked about
              them in class to get a jist of what they were and the different
              aspects typically found in them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once we had an understanding of what explained videos were, we
              were put into groups of three and started brainstorming topics
              for our project. On the resources page of our Canvas site, we
              had all different types of programs to choose from for our video
              project. My group chose to use Bandica for our screen recording
              and Windows Movie Maker for the actual video editing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We watched a couple different videos about biases in media which
              was really helpful and enlightening, especially when thinking of
              a topic to explain. By the end of the week, my group decided that
              we were going to do our Explained Video on Astroturfing.
            </p>
          <h3>Week 8</h3>
            <p>
              I didn't know what Astroturfing was when we first started to
              research it, so I learned a lot when we were preparing. We watched
              an explained video on Net Neutrality, then had to walk through the
              video and explain different aspects of it as one of our classwork/homework
              assignments. It was interesting to do this because I really had to
              pay attention to what was going on in the video. Before, when I
              would watch advertisements, I wouldn't notice the difference
              in how one shot changed to a different one (the transitions) or
              the various effects that one can apply to a video.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we learned from the Net Neutrality video, we started to have more
              ideas about what we wanted to do for our Astroturfing project. We
              continued to learn about Fair Use and basic cuts, which were really
              helpful in choosing what we wanted to do in our video.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later in the week we started to draft some of the panels for what
              we wanted in each scene of our video. My group broke down the scenes
              bsed off of the sections of research that we did. I was in charge
              of the examples, so I found a couple images and videos that I
              thought helped explain what Astroturfing is.
            </p>
          <h3>Week 9</h3>
            <p>
              During the ninth week of classes we mostly just worked on continuing
              our research and figuring out images to put in our videos. My group
              worked pretty well together, so we were able to find some good
              information. By the end of the week, we were supposed to be
              prepared to start working on our videos.
            </p>
          <h3>Week 10</h3>
            <p>
              Week 10 was mostly working on our videos. We had some time in class,
              but other than that, class time was for editing and figuring out the
              next steps our group needed to take in finishing the project. During
              this time my group worked pretty diligently on our research, but didn't
              get very far with the actual video.

          <h3>Week 11</h3>
            <p>
              During week 11 my group really started to figure out what we were
              going to put in our video. I chose to do two separate examples:
              one that explained how astroturfing can work in politics, and
              one that explained how it can happen in a person's everyday life.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first example was from the movie Sydney White, starring Amanda
              Bynes. I chose this becuase it really helped explain how
              astroturfing works to people that are my age, but it also applies
              to people that are in college because it shows how the collegiate
              presidential election works and how people will use
              astroturfing techniques to win votes. The other example I used was
              about a Japanese McDonald's using astroturfing techiniques to get
              customers to buy a quarter pounder.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was all very interesting to me and through my research I
              not only learned what astroturfing was, but also how to explain
              it to others, which my group showed in our explained video.
